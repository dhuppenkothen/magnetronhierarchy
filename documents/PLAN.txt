First fix problem with short spikes. Integrate spikes over bins analytically?
Or make minimum width be bin width... if lazier. Don't think need that
constraint if integrate spikes properly?

Then infer two models:

- Assume all θ come from a single α*
    Iain and Daniela to find beliefs about α*
- Assume all α_m come from a common distribution P(α_m|β)
    Brendon and Daniela to find beliefs about β
